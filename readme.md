***PuzzleScript Video codec***

by Ethan Clark


Okay, so what is this thing? Well, I'll tell you what it is and how it works, but first I'm assuming you know some things:

-what PuzzleScript is
-some very basic knowledge about how it works
-basic pinciples of video encoding (not like I know a whole lot about video encoding, either)

So, here's what this is:

PSV is a program that takes a "video" (just a sequence of images) and outputs PuzzleScript source code containing said "video" (again, just a sequence of images).

How does it work?

I might make a detailed explanation at some point. For now, the source code has a decent ammount of comments.
